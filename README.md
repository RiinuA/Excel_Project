# Bike Sales Dashboard in Excel #
### Data Transformation and Visualization in Excel ###

Welcome! 
In this project, I'm working with a dataset containing customer attributes such as ID, Marital Status, Gender, Income, Children, Education, Occupation, Home Owner, Cars, Commute Distance, Region, Age, and Purchased Bike. The goal of this project is to clean the data, perform data transformations, and create insightful visualizations to gain meaningful insights into customer behavior.

## Dataset ##
The dataset used for this project contains the following columns:

- ID: Customer ID
- Marital Status: Marital status of the customer
- Gender: The gender of the customer
- Income: Customer's income
- Children: Number of children the customer has
- Education: The education level of the customer
- Occupation: Customer's occupation
- Home Owner: Whether the customer owns a home or not
- Cars: Number of cars owned by the customer
- Commute Distance: Customer's commute distance
- Region: Customer's geographical region
- Age: Customer's age
- Purchased Bike: Whether the customer purchased a bike or not
- Data Cleaning
- During the data-cleaning phase, the following tasks were performed:

In the Excel file, you will find the following sheets:
- bike_buyers: This is the original unaltered dataset used for this project
- Working Sheet: On this sheet I performed the data cleaning and transformation
- Pivot table: You will find all pivot tables and initial visualizations on this sheet
- Dashboard: The final result with interactive filters and visualizations. 

## Cleaning and Transformation Process ##

#### Formating Marital Status and Gender Columns #### 
Ensured consistent formatting and cleaned any inconsistencies in the Marital Status and Gender columns.

#### Formating Commute Distance #### 
Improved the display of the Commute Distance column to make it more suitable for pivot table analysis.

#### Creating Age Brackets #### 
Segmented the age data into brackets to facilitate analysis and visualization.

## Pivot Tables ##

After cleaning the data, three pivot tables were created to showcase the following insights:

- Average Income per Purchase: Analyzed the average income of customers who made a bike purchase.
- Customer Commute Distance: Examined the distribution of customers based on their commute distance.
- Customer Age Brackets vs. Purchases: Investigated the relationship between customer age brackets and bike purchases.

## Interactive Dashboard ##
To present the findings in an accessible and engaging manner, an interactive dashboard was designed. The dashboard includes the following filters:

- Education: Filter the data based on the customer's education level.
- Location: Filter the data by geographical region.
- Marital Status: Filter the data by marital status.

The interactive dashboard provides a user-friendly interface to explore the data, allowing users to gain deeper insights by selecting various combinations of filters.

## Usage ##
